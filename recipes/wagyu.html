    <h2>Description</h2>

      of Japan, Wagyu beef is shipped carrying area names. Some examples are
      Matsusaka beef, Kobe beef, Yonezawa beef, Mishima beef, ÅŒmi beef, and
      Sanda beef

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Wagyu Steak</li>
      <li>Salt & Pepper, To Taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Rest: Rest your steak at room temperature 30 minutes to an hour before
        cooking. This creates an even temperature in the steak allowing you to
        cook it evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: Salt steak with Kosher salt on both sides. The salt draws out some
        of the fat and juices of the steak to create a delicious, flavorful
        crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat: Take your cast iron pan or stainless steel skillet and put it on
        the stove at medium heat. Allow the pan to get hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease: Rub the fat cap around the steak on the entire inside of the
        pan. The fat will begin to melt and "grease" the pan to prevent the
        steak from sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook: Place the steak on the hot cast iron or stainless steel pan and
        cook for about a minute and half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip: Flip the steak and cook until the internal temperature reaches
        about 120 to 125 degrees for rare or 130 to 135 degrees for medium rare.
      </li>
      <li>Rest: Rest 5 to 10 minutes then slice into strips.</li>
    </ol>
