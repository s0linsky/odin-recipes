    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Chicken parmesan, or chicken parmigiana, is a dish that consists of
      breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan,
      or provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added. The

      <li>1/3 cup fresh shredded parmesan cheese</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <p>For The Chicken:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven 430°F | 220°C. Lightly grease an oven tray (or baking dish)
        with non stick cooking oil spray; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together eggs, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper in a shallow dish.
        Add chicken into the egg, rotating to evenly coat each fillet in the
        mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to marinate for at least 15
        minutes (or overnight night if time allows for a deeper flavour).
      </li>
      <li>
        When chicken is ready for cooking, mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and
        garlic powder together in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into the
        breadcrumb mixture to evenly coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot and
        shimmering. Fry chicken until golden and crispy, (about 4-5 minutes each
        side).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken on prepared baking tray / dish and top each breast with
        about 1/3 cup of sauce (sauce recipe below). Top each chicken breast
        with 2-3 slices of mozzarella cheese and about 2 tablespoons parmesan
        cheese. Sprinkle with basil or parsley.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until cheese is bubbling and melted, and the
        chicken is completely cooked through.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>For The Sauce:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a medium-sized pot. Fry onion until transparent (about 3
        minutes), then add the garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomato puree, salt and pepper to taste, Italian herbs and sugar
        (If using). Cover with lid to simmer for about 8 minutes, or until sauce
        has thickened slightly. Taste test and adjust salt and pepper, if
        needed.
      </li>
    </ol>
