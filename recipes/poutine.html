    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the gravy: In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the water
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan, melt the butter. Add the flour and cook, stirring
        regularly, for about 5 minutes, until the mixture turns golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the beef and chicken broth and bring to a boil, stirring with a
        whisk. Stir in about HALF the cornstarch mixture and simmer for a minute
        or so. If you'd like your gravy thicker, add a more of the cornstarch
        mixture, in small increments, as needed, to thicken. Season with pepper.
        Taste and add additional salt, if necessary, to taste. Make ahead and
        re-warm or keep warm until your fries are ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Deep-Fried Fries: Prepare your potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch thick
        sticks. Place into a large bowl and cover completely with cold water.
        Allow to stand at least one hour or several hours. When ready to cook,
        heat your oil in your deep fryer or large, wide, heavy cooking pot to
        300° F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the potatoes from the water and place onto a sheet of paper
        towel. Blot to remove as much excess moisture as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your fries to the 300°F oil and cook for 5-8 minutes, just until
        potatoes are starting to cook but are not yet browned. Remove potatoes
        from oil and scatter on a wire rack. Increase oil temperature to 375°F
        Once oil is heated to that temperature, return the potatoes to the fryer
        and cook until potatoes are golden brown. Remove to a paper towel-lined
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        To Prepare Poutine: Add your fried or baked fries to a large, clean
        bowl. Season lightly with salt while still warm. Add a ladle of hot
        poutine gravy to the bowl and using tongs, toss the fries in the gravy.
        Add more gravy, as needed to mostly coat the fries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cheese curds and toss with the hot fries and gravy. Serve with
        freshly ground pepper. Serve immediately.
